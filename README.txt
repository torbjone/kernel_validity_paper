Code to reproduce all results figures from the paper
"On the validity of electric brain signal predictions based on population firing rates"
by Torbj√∏rn V. Ness, Tom Tetzlaff, Gaute T. Einevoll, and David Dahmen

Installation has not been thoroughly tested on different systems, but on Ubuntu
with virtual environments this worked for me:

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# System dependency: NEST Simulator
# Can for example be installed via:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nest-simulator/nest
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nest

Some simulations are time-consuming, and MPI and patience is recommended
